# General Game Mechanics Foreword
- Pick **Chaos** every chance you can. Keep **Law** and **Gray** relatively equal throughout the game.
 - Later in the game you will have different routes you can take based upon your L.G.C. alignment, but if you don't pick every Chaos you won't have enough to do that route.
