# October 18th Day
### Systems Comment
- The Virtual Combat Simulator is worth doing. They are only as strong as they chapter they are added in, so doing Ch4's in Ch5 will make them 'weaker' relative to you.
  - There will only be 6 bosses in here.
- They all drop U-Material+ and this is a viable strat of farming it, if needed.
- There is also an achievement tied to it that gives a good quartz.
