# Final Dungeon
- If any of your alignments are at Level 5, there will be an optional boss corresponding to that alignment that will drop a very good accessory.
  - If they are not at max, there will be seemingly empty areas of this dungeon where that boss would have been.
- Good luck with the final boss, it's a relatively hard one.
