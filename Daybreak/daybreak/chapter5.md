  - Chaos 3: || Ouroboros ||
  - Law + Chaos >= 5: || Ikaruga ||
- From here on out, alignment doesn't matter besides affecting a cutscene in the finale and maxing out an alignment.
  - There will be a lot of alignment choices in each route (too many to reasonably do), just go with your gut. I will continue to include them for side quests though.
