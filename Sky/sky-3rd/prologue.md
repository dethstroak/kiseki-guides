# Notes for Acheivements
- Make sure to examine each chest twice. They will have a unique message and you will need to examine every chest in order to get the acheivement.
- There is also an acheivement for obtaining an item later in the game for either fighing 300 battles with never running away or running away 300 times. It is recommended to playthrough the game never running from a fight until you get the first item and then making a save to get the acheivement for the other. If you run from a fight anytime during the game you are not able to get one of the items.
