**NOTES:**
- For the chests make sure to open each one twice to get the chest message
- For recipes consume the meal to learn it
- If you are interested in the sidequests be sure to check for more everytime you turn in a main quest to see new ones. Sidequests are very missable so if you want to do them do them before progressing the main story.
- Make sure to read all the books when you get them if you want the achievement
