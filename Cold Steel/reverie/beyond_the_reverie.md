# Beyond the Reverie
## Premise
- You're just gonna be rushing up the stratum to a big final boss
 - Feel free to drop the difficulty down, as there's nothing missable
 - You will get cutscenes on finishing each stratum
- There are a few more characters that can be unlocked here
- Make sure to get the appropriate sealing stones for unlocking Daydreams as needed
- Hint for the final boss:
    - || Equip deathblow resistance accessories ||
    - || Make sure your strongest team is Team C ||
