# Introduction
## Drama CD Transcript
There is a drama CD that occurs between the end of Chapter 6 and the beginning of the Finale. I did not read the offical transcript of it myself when I played the game, but there are no spoilers here. It is hosted on the Cold Steel 2 promotional website, so don't click around too much if you do read it. **It isn't needed to understand the plot.**
